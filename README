***** BUILDING

Try this:

	$ make

It will probably not work, as this was a very weirdly-built class project
at UC Berkeley with very particular requirements and systems. Good luck...

****** RUNNING

the command line options all correspond to items that are toggle-able mid-game as well.

	-l / +l		A setting of +l enables low quality rendering, -l disables.
				+l by default.

	-s / +s		+s enables starry background, -s disables.
				+s by default.

	-p / +p		+p enables particles, -p disables
				+p by default.

	-q / +q		+q enables qwerty control mode, -q disables (enables dvorak)
				-q by default

	-g / +g		+g enables gravity, -g disables
				-g by default

the fastest settings would be

	$ ./gravwars +l -s -p -g

the fanciest is
	
	$ ./gravwars -l +s +p +g
	
	
***************** PLAYING

THE BACKGROUND

	You are the pilot of the revolutionary gravitic drive Q-wing fighter.  It can propel itself
	in any directien except backwards, and is equipped with photonicaliphragisizmic torpedos.

	You are also just a garbage man assigned to eliminate some dangerous asteroids in a region
	that is desirable for inter-galactic housing development.  Read on for mission details.
	

THE CONTROLS

	Your Grav-O-Matic(tm) thrusters are controlled by the arrow keys and space bar.  space is
	forward thrust and the arrows are lateral stabilizers.


	Your pivot controls depend on whether you are dvorak or qwerty.

	For dvorak, they are:

	,	.	p		
	o	e	u


	, - roll left
	p - roll right
	. - pitch down
	e - pitch up
	o - turn left
	u - turn right

	For qwerty they are:

	w	e	r
	s	d	f

	with the same configuration as above.  Note: you need to run ./gravwars +q for qwerty control.

	Some other keys that are common to both layouts:

	g - toggle <G>ravity
	x - toggle particle effe<X>
	i - toggle <I>nput mode (qwerty / dvorak)
	b - toggle starry <B>ackground
	v - toggle <V>isual quality
	q - <Q>uit
	

Happy hunting!!
